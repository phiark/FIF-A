\begin{abstract}
We introduce \textbf{Frictional Interaction Fields (FIF)}, a symmetric, energy-based inductive bias that models cross-channel disagreement as physical \emph{friction}.
Unlike attention, which relies on asymmetric similarity weighting, FIF penalizes inconsistency between modalities through an energy minimization process, yielding equilibrium representations rather than attention-weighted averages.
We present both continuous and discrete formulations, highlight its relation to Laplacian energy, anisotropic diffusion, and gradient flow, and discuss how external task constraints act as multidimensional pressures.
A toy-level prototype suggests that FIF produces a frictional energy metric linearly correlated with task conflict and exhibits improved stability under synthetic noise.
This paper serves as an early conceptual report.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
Attention mechanisms dominate contemporary deep architectures by focusing on similarity-based relevance between features.
However, when modalities conflict, such asymmetric focusing fails to capture the \emph{cost of disagreement}.
We propose FIF, where the system seeks equilibrium by dissipating internal tension.
Intelligence here is not the art of selecting importance but of balancing contradictions.

Our contributions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item A symmetric, energy-driven coupling mechanism replacing probabilistic weighting.
\item A unified view over continuous fields, discrete graphs, and sequences.
\item An interpretable internal metric---the frictional energy---quantifying task difficulty and cognitive load.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Method}
\subsection{Continuous formulation}
Let $v_m(x)$ denote the $m$-th information field on domain $\Omega$.
We define the total energy $E$.

\begin{align*}
    E = \sum_{m<n}\int_\Omega (v_m - v_n)^\top \mu_{mn}(x) (v_m - v_n)\,dx 
        & + \lambda \sum_m \int_\Omega \|\nabla v_m\|^2 dx \\
        & - \int_\Omega q(x)^\top v(x)\,dx ,
\end{align*}
where $\mu_{mn}(x)$ is a positive semi-definite friction tensor and $q(x)$ is an external pressure term.
The dynamics follow a gradient flow toward equilibrium.

\partial_t v = -\delta E/\delta v
\]

\subsection{Discrete formulation}
Stacking node features $h\in\mathbb{R}^{N\times d}$, let $L_\mu$ be the friction Laplacian constructed from $\mu_{ij}$.
The equilibrium condition is
\[
(L_\mu+\varepsilon I)h = q,
\]
approximated iteratively by
\[
h^{t+1} = h^t - \eta (L_\mu h^t - q), \quad t=0\dots K-1.
\]
We employ diagonal positive $\mu_{ij}=\text{softplus}(W_{ij})$ and small $\lambda$-regularization for numerical stability.

\section{Comparison with Attention}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Asymmetry vs Symmetry:} Attention is directional ($Q\to K$), FIF is bidirectional ($i\leftrightarrow j$).
\item \textbf{Normalization:} Attention uses softmax normalization, sensitive to temperature; FIF normalizes implicitly via convex energy minimization.
\item \textbf{Complexity:} Full attention costs $\mathcal{O}(N^2d)$; with sparse $\mu$, FIF reduces to $\mathcal{O}(KNd)$.
\item \textbf{Interpretability:} Frictional energy serves as a first-order metric of conflict, correlated with task difficulty.
\end{itemize}

\section{Preliminary Predictive Results}
We simulated a synthetic ``conflict'' parameter $c\in[0,1.0]$ representing modality disagreement.
The baseline is a standard softmax attention layer; FIF employs a 5-step iterative solver with diagonal friction.
All numbers below are averaged over multiple toy runs (not controlled experiments).

\caption{Predicted trend: frictional energy grows linearly with conflict; FIF remains stable or improves slightly under noise.}
\end{table}

These results are qualitative; no optimization or hyperparameter search was conducted.
Nevertheless, the linearity of energy and the stable behavior suggest the architecture's potential robustness.

\section{Discussion}
FIF changes the semantics of connection:
in attention, connection means ``which input I attend to'';
in FIF, connection means ``which forces reach equilibrium.''
Thus, FIF can handle contradictory inputs more gracefully, exhibiting dynamics closer to real neural processes, where cognition emerges from balancing tension, not maximizing similarity.

\section{Conclusion}
FIF redefines the notion of connection as \emph{dissipative coupling}.
By replacing softmax attention with energy equilibrium, we obtain a stable, symmetric, interpretable inductive bias that naturally produces a measure of internal cognitive effort.
While current prototypes are toy-level, we hypothesize that such energy-based dynamics may lead to more self-regulating and, in a deeper sense, more intelligent systems.
